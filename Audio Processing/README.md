# Audio Procesing Test Bed
This directory contains a Python based test bed for developing and refining the audio processing algorithms that will be used on the Arduino. 

This code runs on the desktop and runs off the audio output of the computer itself and provides a way of developing these algorithms in an environment that is easier to debug and provides more visiblity than on the Arduino itself.
